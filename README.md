# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
As online shopping becomes more and more frequent, credit card frauds have been one of the most annoying problem for both bank and customers. In the past, I also have encountered several differnt credit card frauds. So, even though I have not lost any asset or money in the past, I become really concerned about this issue and do not really trust any online transaction any more.

As an enthusiastic data scientist, I decide to do something to make the world better. In this project, I create a highly accurate XGBoost Classification model to detect credit card frauds, based on the online transaction simulation data generated by Kartik Shenoy. The data was generated using Sparkov Data Generation | Github tool created by Brandon Harris. This simulation was run for the duration - 1 Jan 2019 to 31 Dec 2020. https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection

The entire visualization is done using Tableau interactive dashboard. You can access it via the link below.

Given that most of the files are too big, I stored all the data on google drive. If you are interested, feel free to access the raw data and R files with this link.
